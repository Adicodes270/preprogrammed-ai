# Why created this repository

I made this preprogrammed ai for a school project 

# Very easy project to make
This is a very easy project to make using dictionary and using for loops we can also use apis to also make something like JARVIS AI which I would try to do after I am done with fc-tools-two.vercel.app

# Use 

You just have to run main.py in a code editor thats it
